# Slider_TCSPC2Phasor

Small interactive script to visualise how a TCSPC curve maps onto the phasor plot.
You can change the TCSPC decay using one or two lifetime components and tune the amplitude of either. 
The code assumes 80 MHz laser repetition rate (for now) and gives thus a TCSPC window of 12.5 ns filled by 100 TCSPC bins. 

No warranties - this is all pretty much under construction :D
Demo of how it looks like [here] (https://twitter.com/faldalf/status/1423181527312048129).
